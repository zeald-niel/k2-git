Event Tickets allows your visitors to RSVP to events on your site.  Also works seamlessly with The Events Calendar.

== Description ==

Event Tickets provides a simple way for visitors to RSVP to your events. As a standalone plugin, it enables you to add RSVP functionality to posts or pages. When paired with [The Events Calendar](http://m.tri.be/18tg), you can add that same RSVP functionality directly to your event listings.

Admins are able to access RSVP information from the backend, allowing them to check in registered attendees with ease when your event begins. For free events, Events Tickets allows you to own the entire event management process within your WordPress site.

<strong>Check out [Event Tickets Plus](http://m.tri.be/18th) and [other add-ons](http://m.tri.be/2a)</strong>

><strong>Sell tickets on your site!</strong>
>Take full control of the event ticketing process and customize it to suit your needs. Event Tickets Plus uses your favorite e-commerce provider to keep users on your site from start to finish. Configure custom attendee registration forms to collect information like t-shirt size or food preferences.
>[Upgrade to Event Ticket Plus now](http://m.tri.be/18th).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I go to file a bug or ask a question? =

Users of the free plugin can post in the [Event Tickets support forum on WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/event-tickets/). Our team reviews that forum weekly to look for bug reports. If you need more in-depth help, consider purchasing a license for [Tickets Plus](http://m.tri.be/18th). A valid license gives you access to our [premium support forums](http://m.tri.be/18u1) which are checked daily.

= Are there any troubleshooting steps you'd suggest I try that might resolve my issue before I post a new thread? =

First, make sure that you're running the latest version of Event Tickets. If you've got any other add-ons, make sure those are current / running the latest code as well.

The most common issues we see are either plugin or theme conflicts. You can test if a plugin or theme is conflicting by manually deactivating other plugins until just Event Tickets is running on your site. If the issue persists from there, revert to the default Twenty Fifteen theme. If the issue is resolved after deactivating a specific plugin or your theme, you'll know that is the source of the conflict.

Note that we aren't going to say "tough luck" if you identify a plugin/theme conflict. While we can't guarantee 100% integration with any plugin or theme out there, we will do our best (and reach out the plugin/theme author as needed) to figure out a solution that benefits everyone.

= Event Tickets Plus is just what I need! I'm sold! How can I get my hands on it? =

Events Tickets Plus can be purchased directly on [our website](http://m.tri.be/18th). There are five (5) license types available, and all licenses include access to premium support, new feature releases, and regular maintenance updates.

= I'm interested in Event Tickets Plus or another add-on, but I have a few questions before making the purchase. Can you help me get those addressed? =

Absolutely. If you're not finding your questions answered on the product pages, hit up our [pre-sales forum](http://m.tri.be/2w) on our site. You can save yourself some time by reviewing the threads first to verify if your question has already been asked. If it hasn't, post a new thread as a guest. We'll get you a reply as quickly as we can, so you can make an informed decision regarding purchase.

= What add-ons are available for Event Tickets, and where can I read more about them? =

Currently, the following add-ons are available for Event Tickets:

* [Event Tickets Plus](http://m.tri.be/18wk), for selling tickets to your events using your favorite e-commerce platform.
* [The Events Calendar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-events-calendar/), for managing a full calendar of events with ease.
